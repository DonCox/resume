			<p>
				I am a seasoned, enthusiastic professional with over 37 years of IT experience. I am seeking a position within
				an organization that offers a dynamic and progressive atmosphere that will provide my next set of challenges.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe my biggest asset is that I am a self motivated individual who requires very little supervision and
				has an innate ability to analyze and solve issues independently.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have always found it immensely fulfilling to overcome particularly vexing issues with very little
				outside help. When learning something new I find it better to rely on actual trial and error 
				coupled with a heavy dose of Google searches to facilitate the process. It takes me very little time to 
				quickly comprehend new subjects, and this is an asset in any environment.
			</p>
			<p>
				By quickly glancing at my resume, one will see that I have a well rounded IT background. I look 
				forward to meeting you face-to-face soon to discuss how I can become an asset for your company.
